 Preface is far too brief to be used in such a course. You might find it useful to use an additional work on NP-completeness to augment this text. Exercises Exercises, provided at the end of each chapter, match the order in which material is presented. The last exercises may address the chapter as a whole rather than a specific section. 
        Difficult exercises are marked with an asterisk, and more challenging exercises have two
        asterisks. Referenc References are placed at the end of each chapter. Generally the references either are historical, representing the original source of the material, or they represent extensions and improvements to the results given in the text. Some references represent solutions to exercises.Supplements The following supplements are available to all readers at http://cssupport.pearsoncmg.com/  Source code for example programs  Errata In addition, the following material is available only to qualified instructors at Pearson Instructor Resource Center (www.pearsonhighered.com/irc). Visit the IRC or contact your Pearson Education sales representative for access.  Solutions to selected exercises  Figures from the book  Errata Acknowledgments Many, many people have helped me in the preparation of books in this series. Some are listed in other versions of the book; thanks to all. As usual, the writing process was made easier by the professionals at Pearson. I’d like to thank my editor, Tracy Johnson, and production editor, Marilyn Lloyd. My wonderful wife Jill deserves extra special thanks for everything she does. Finally, I’d like to thank the numerous readers who have sent e-mail messages and pointed out errors or inconsistencies in earlier versions. My website www.cis.fiu.edu/~weiss will also contain updated source code (in C++ and Java), an errata list, and a link to submit bug reports. M.A.W. Miami, Florida4 columns</div>
